## Project Milestones

### 1. Data Preparation (Python Notebook)

* Load raw environmental datasets.
* Perform **intensive cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering**.
* Handle missing values, drop irrelevant metadata, reshape data into a long format.
* Deliver a **structured and reliable dataset** that serves as the foundation for all analyses.

### 2. Interactive Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)

* Import the cleaned dataset into **Power BI**.
* Build **dynamic dashboards** for exploratory analysis.
* Provide **interactive storytelling tools** for users to explore:

  * Global and country-level CO₂ emissions.
  * Energy consumption trends.
  * Comparisons across regions and time.

📌 A more detailed explanation (with screenshots) is available in the [Interactive Visualization README](./sources/interactive-visualization/README.md).

### 3. Predictive Modeling (Python Notebook)

* Use the prepared dataset for **machine learning**.
* Develop and train models to **forecast future CO₂ emissions and energy use**.
* Generate **data-driven insights** to support informed decision-making.
